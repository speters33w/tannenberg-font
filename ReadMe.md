While German Fraktur (Gotische Schrift)  fonts were heavily used in Nazi Germany, and are still used by neo-Nazi organizations, it would be more accurate to name them "German fonts," or "Bismarck Fonts," rather than "Nazi fonts." In an [edict signed by Martin Bormann in January, 1941](https://alphahistory.com/pastpeculiar/1941-nazis-ban-jewish-fonts/), (interestingly under a Fraktur letterhead), the Nazis called for a ban on the future use of *Judenlettern* (‘Jewish fonts’) like *Fraktur*.
